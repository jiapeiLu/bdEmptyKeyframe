This Add-on is in beta. If you have any question. Kindly let me know.

"blank_frame_manager.py" is a handy add-on for helping animators quickly add blank/empty frames ( not keyframe ) in between keyframes during object and pose mode.

Suggestions:
If you want to use hot key. I found this setting is less changed and suit for animating.
Add blank: ctrl + Numpad+
Remove blank: ctrl + Numpad-
Key Unlocked: ctrl + I

If you are new to blender. you may try the "Blender_blankKey.py". I've setting Object/Pose/Dopesheet/GraphEditor with the hot key below.
